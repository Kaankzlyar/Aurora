🎨 UI/UX Improvements - Button Standardization
1. Created GoldenButton Component
File: GoldenButton.tsx
Purpose: Reusable button component with consistent golden gradient design
Features:
Golden gradient colors: #D4AF37, #C48913, #B8860B
Configurable sizes: small, medium, large
Optional icons with proper centering
Conditional text rendering (fixes icon centering when title is empty)
Shadow effects and rounded corners
2. Button Replacements Across App
my-cards.tsx:
✅ "İlk Kartını Ekle" button → GoldenButton
✅ Header add button (+ icon) → GoldenButton
add-address.tsx:
✅ "Adresi Kaydet" button → GoldenButton
add-card.tsx:
✅ "Kartı Kaydet" button → GoldenButton
FilterModal.tsx:
✅ "Uygula" button → GoldenButton
🔐 Authentication Fixes
3. Token Validation Issues Resolved
Problem: Users were asked to login even after being authenticated
Root Cause: Screens only checked isAuthenticated from context, not actual token storage
4. add-card.tsx Authentication Fix
✅ Added useEffect for token checking on page load
✅ Added currentToken and authChecked state management
✅ Added loading state while checking authentication
✅ Proper error handling and console logging
5. add-address.tsx Authentication Fix
✅ Added similar token checking mechanism
✅ Loading state during authentication check
✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
🐛 Bug Fixes
6. Icon Centering Issue
Problem: + icon in header button wasn't centered due to empty text element
Solution: Modified GoldenButton to conditionally render text only when title exists
Technical Fix:
7. Icon Visibility Issue
Problem: Icons were hard to see against golden gradient
Attempted Solution: Tried changing icon color from black to white
Note: User reverted this change, so final implementation kept original colors
