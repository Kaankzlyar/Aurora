🎯 Main Problem
The OrderManagement page was displaying "Henüz hiç sipariş yok" (No orders yet) despite the database containing 13 orders and the backend API working correctly.

🔧 Changes Made
1. Fixed TypeScript Type Definition
File: api.ts

Issue: The LoginResponse["user"] type was missing the isSuperAdmin property
Change: Added isSuperAdmin: boolean; to the user type definition
Impact: Resolved 5 TypeScript errors in OrderManagement.tsx related to accessing user.isSuperAdmin
2. Added Comprehensive Debugging System
File: OrderManagement.tsx

A. Authentication & Authorization Debug:

Added detailed logging for user authentication state
Added logging for admin privilege checks
Added JSON serialization of user object for inspection
B. API Call Debug:

Added logging when fetchOrders() is called
Added logging for API response data, type, and length validation
Added debug calls to /api/orders/debug/count and /api/orders/debug/list
Added logging for state updates
C. Component Lifecycle Debug:

Added logging for useEffect triggers and conditions
Added separate useEffect to track orders state changes
Added logging for authorization condition checks
3. UI/UX Enhancements
A. Magic Bento Design Implementation:

Added reactbits library integration
Implemented magic bento layout components
Enhanced visual design with modern card layouts
B. Header Redesign:

Updated header styling and layout
Improved navigation structure
Enhanced responsiveness
C. Admin Management Access:

Added Admin Management page access button
Integrated ShinyText component for admin styling
Created visual hierarchy for admin controls
D. Admin Panel Visual Improvements:

Implemented ShinyText effects for admin elements
Enhanced admin interface with modern animations
Improved user experience for admin functions
🔍 Debug Features Added
🎯 Current Status
✅ Completed:

TypeScript errors resolved
Comprehensive debugging system implemented
Backend API confirmed working (13 orders in database)
Debug endpoints successfully tested
Magic bento design with reactbits library
Header redesign and improvements
Admin Management page access button
ShinyText admin styling implementation
🔄 In Progress:

Awaiting browser console logs to identify the exact issue
Need to test frontend with debug logging to see where the flow breaks
🚀 Next Steps
The debugging system will help identify if the issue is with:

User authentication state - Is the user properly loaded?
Admin authorization - Are admin checks passing?
API execution - Is fetchOrders actually being called?
API response - Is the data coming back correctly?
State management - Is the orders array being updated properly?
🎨 Visual Enhancements Added
Modern bento grid layout using reactbits
Animated ShinyText for admin elements
Improved header design and navigation
Enhanced admin management accessibility
Better visual hierarchy and user experience
