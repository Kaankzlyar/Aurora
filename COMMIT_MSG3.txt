✅ Added getCurrentToken() function for centralized token access
✅ Fixed login() function to properly read stored tokens
✅ Added delay to ensure token storage synchronization
✅ Improved error handling and logging
2. frontend/frontend/app/(tabs)/favorites.tsx
✅ Removed local token state management
✅ Integrated with centralized AuthContext token system
✅ Added comprehensive token validation and expiration checks
