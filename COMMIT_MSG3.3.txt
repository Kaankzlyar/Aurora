Aurora ChangeLog v3.0
ðŸŽ¯ Main Issue Fixed:
"You need to login first" message appearing even when users were already logged in
ðŸ”§ Files Modified:
1. frontend/frontend/utils/tokenValidator.ts
Enhanced JWT Validation Logic
Added manual JWT decoding as primary method
Added fallback to getUserInfoFromToken if manual decode fails
Improved error handling to prevent false authentication failures
Only redirects to login when token is actually expired (not on validation errors)
2. frontend/frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
Improved Authentication State Management
Made checkAuthStatus more resilient to validation errors
Prioritizes token existence over perfect validation
Prevents unnecessary logouts due to minor validation issues
Better error recovery and fallback mechanisms
3. frontend/frontend/app/add-card.tsx
Replaced Alert System with Notification System
Removed all Alert.alert calls
Integrated useNotification hook
Added NotificationAlert component
Consistent styling with the rest of the app
4. frontend/frontend/app/add-address.tsx
Removed Unused Alert Import
Cleaned up unused Alert import
All notifications already using custom system
ðŸš€ Key Improvements:
Authentication Resilience
Minor JWT validation issues no longer log users out
Network problems don't cause authentication failures
System maintains authenticated state when possible
Better User Experience
No more false "login required" messages
Consistent notification styling across all pages
More reliable authentication state management
Robust Error Handling
Multiple fallback validation methods
Graceful degradation on validation errors
Better debugging and logging
âœ… Result:
Users who are already logged in will no longer see the "you need to login first" message due to minor validation issues. The app is now much more resilient and only logs users out when their token is actually expired or completely invalid.
