🎯 Today's Development Summary - September 3, 2025
🔧 Major Issues Fixed:
1. API Special Today Endpoint - Complete Rebuild
Problem: GET /api/products/special-today was returning empty results due to Entity Framework translation errors
Root Cause: IsOnDiscount was a computed property that couldn't be translated to SQL
Solution:
Fixed all Product controller methods to use database columns (OriginalPrice, DiscountPercentage) instead of computed properties
Created deterministic algorithm for daily special products
Implemented date-based seeding for consistent daily results
2. React Hooks Order Error - Frontend
Problem: Hooks were being called in different order between renders in special-today.tsx
Root Cause: useNotification() was called outside component function
Solution: Moved all hooks inside component and restructured ProductCard props
3. Cart Service Integration Bug
Problem: addToCart function calls were using wrong parameter order
Root Cause: Cart service expects (token, productId, quantity) but was called with (productId, quantity)
Solution: Fixed all cart service calls across the application
🚀 New Features Implemented:
1. Deterministic "Special Today" Algorithm
Key Benefits:

✅ Same 5 products stay special for entire day
✅ Automatic daily reset at midnight
✅ 5-20% random but consistent discounts
✅ Fallback algorithm for reliability
2. Real-time Cart Counter on Home Page
Features:

🔄 Auto-refresh: Updates when returning to home tab
⏰ Periodic sync: Every 30 seconds while active
🎯 Smart display: Shows "99+" for large quantities
🔐 Auth-aware: Handles login/logout states
📋 Technical Improvements:
1. Backend API Fixes (C# .NET)
Fixed Entity Framework query translation issues
Improved error handling in ProductsController
Added proper fallback mechanisms
Enhanced logging for debugging
2. Frontend React Native Fixes
Resolved hooks order violations
Fixed cart service parameter order
Improved component prop structure
Enhanced error handling and user feedback
3. State Management Enhancements
