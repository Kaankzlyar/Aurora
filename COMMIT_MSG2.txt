Aurora v2.2 New Improvements and bug fix
1. Backdrop Opacity Problem:
Issue: Backdrop opacity is tied to slide animation
Result: Backdrop may linger or fade incorrectly when modal closes
Why: No separate backdrop animation control
2. Animation Timing:
Issue: Slide and backdrop animations are not synchronized
Result: Uneven animation appearance
Why: Removed Animated.parallel() for backdrop
3. State Management:
Issue: No closing state tracking
Result: Can't control when backdrop should fade
Why: Removed isClosing state
🎯 Current Functionality:
✅ Modal opens with slide-up animation
✅ Modal closes with slide-down animation
✅ Basic backdrop with opacity tied to slide
✅ Touch interactions (close button, backdrop press)
✅ UI components (order buttons, direction buttons, apply button)
📝 Summary:
The user has simplified the OrderModal by removing the complex backdrop animation system I implemented to fix the opacity issues. The current version uses a basic approach where backdrop opacity is directly tied to the slide animation, which may cause the backdrop to linger or fade incorrectly when the modal closes.
The modal will still function but may have visual inconsistencies with the backdrop animation timing.
